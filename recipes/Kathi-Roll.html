    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1 </b>Knead a smooth dough</li>
        <p>Kathi Roll is one of the easiest recipes to prepare at home. Hereâ€™s how you prepare this scrumptious snack recipe. First, you need to prepare the dough., Take a dough kneading plate and add wheat flour in it along with a little salt. Mix well and then add water in batches to knead a soft and smooth dough. Once the dough is ready, cover with a damp cotton cloth and keep it aside till required.</p>
        
        <li><b>Step 2 </b>Pressure cook the potatos & chop the veggies</li>
        <p>Afterwards, put a pressure cooker on high flame and add potato in it along with enough water to submerge the potato in it. Close the lid of the cooker and cook for 2 whistles. Once cooked, let the steam release on its own and then drain the extra water and peel the potato in a bowl, mash it using a masher. Now, wash tomato and capsicum in running water and finely chop them in separate bowls. Peel the onion and thinly slice it in a bowl, keep aside till required.</p>

        <li><b>Step 3 </b>Saute the onion</li>
        <p>Put a non-stick pan on medium flame and heat oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin and mustard seeds in it, when they start to crackle, add a pinch of asafoetida along with salt. Saute for a few seconds and then add the onions in it. Saute the onions until translucent and pink in colour.</p>

        <li><b>Step 4 </b>Cook veggies in ginger garlic paste & spices</li>
        <p>Now, add garlic paste in the pan and saute for a minute, and quickly add capsicum along with tomato in the pan. Stir to mix all the spices and then add mashed potato in it. Mix once again and cook for 2 minutes. Afterwards, add turmeric, garam masala, chilli and coriander powder in the pan and toss lightly to incorporate the spices well with vegetables. Let the veggies cook for 2-3 minutes, then close the lid of the pan and lower the flame. Let the veggies cook for about 5 minutes.</p>

        <li><b>Step 5 </b>Roll out the chapati</li>
        <p>Meanwhile, unwrap the dough and divide it into 2-3 equal parts on a flat surface and make a ball of each. Using a little flour, roll these balls into the shape of a chapati.</p>

        <li><b>Step 6 </b>Cook both sides of the chapati</li>
        <p>Put a Tawa on medium flame and when it's mildly hot, carefully transfer the chapati on the heated Tawa. When tiny bubbles start to rise, flip it with a spatula and cook until both sides are golden brown. Apply a little oil on both sides and cook well. Put it aside and repeat the procedure to make more chapatis for the roll. By now, the veggies will be done, switch off the flame and transfer the veggies to a bowl.</p>

        <li><b>Step 7 </b>Stuff the chapati with veggies to make the Kathi Rolls</li>
        <p>Take chapati and apply a teaspoon of the green chutney evenly on one side. Then, add sufficient amount of cooked vegetables in the middle of the chapati. Garnish with some raw onion slices and chopped coriander leaves, and wrap it tightly to make a roll. Repeat to make more such Kathi rolls and serve hot!</p>
